This could be a character, an obstacle, a platform, a bullet - you name it. The entity is a container for a set of components. A character entity for example might consist of a position component, a sprite component and a velocity component. Entities are only references, they do not hold any data of their own. A system manipulates component data by querying for entities based on their components. Example: A system might query for anything that has a position component and a velocity component and then updates the position based on the velocity. The system is completely indifferent as to what the specific entities represent, it only cares for the components involved. With these concepts ECS allows for very efficient code reuse, because behaviors are not bound to specific classes, but emerge from a combination of atomic components and systems. This not only makes it easier to introduce new ideas to an existing game, but also to share code across multiple projects. nopun-ecs also introduces the concept of scenes on top of the ECS vocabulary. Scenes define a context boundary within which entities and systems exist (other ECS implementations might call this world). Multiple scenes can be stitched together to form a tree structure, which allows for complexer game designs.
